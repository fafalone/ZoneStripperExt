This is a companion to my [ZoneStripper program](https://github.com/fafalone/ZoneStripper) to remove the Zone.Identifier NTFS alternate data stream, also known as 'The mark of the web', that indicates to Windows and MS Office that a file came from the internet.

It adds options to remove it or change it to trusted, and if you select a folder it will be applied recursively to all files within that folder and subfolders.
